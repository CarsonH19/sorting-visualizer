# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive application that animates the sorting process of various algorithms, helping users understand and learn about sorting techniques in an engaging way.

## Why

I built the Sorting Visualizer to provide an educational tool that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. My goal is to enhance understanding of algorithms, making learning more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

## Live Site

https://sorting-visualizer-flax-two.vercel.app

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch different sorting algorithms in action.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to visualize.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the animations to follow along at your own pace.
- **Detailed Explanations:** Learn about the mechanics of each algorithm through informative descriptions.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Usage

Follow these steps to start using the Sorting Visualizer:

1. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options in the dropdown menu.

2. **Start the Visualization:**
   - Click the "Start" button to begin the sorting animation.

3. **Control Speed:**
   - Use the speed control slider to adjust how fast the sorting occurs.

4. **View Results:**
   - Observe the array as it gets sorted in real-time, allowing you to visualize how the algorithm operates.

5. **Explore Different Algorithms:**
   - After completing one algorithm, feel free to select another and repeat the process to compare their behaviors.
